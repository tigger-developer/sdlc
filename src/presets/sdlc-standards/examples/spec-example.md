# Feature Specification: Scheduled Report Delivery

## Specification Summary

- **Outcome:** An account owner **receives scheduled reports**, while an
  operator can **retry an execution** without duplicate output.
- **Before:**
  - Reports are generated **manually** using the existing renderer.
  - No scheduled generation or recipient delivery behaviour is defined.
- **After:**
  - Each successful scheduled **run** stores **one archived report**.
  - Configured recipients receive **one notification** per successful run.
  - Retrying the **same execution identifier** creates **no duplicate report or
    notification**.
- **Changes:**
  - A report schedule declares an **output format** and optional **recipients**.
  - An **invalid output format** prevents the schedule being saved and identifies
    the invalid value.
- **Unchanged:**
  - The existing report **renderer**, manual generation, account authorization,
    and retention policy remain unchanged.
- **Edge cases:**
  - An **empty recipient list** disables delivery but still archives the report.
  - A **delivery failure** leaves the generated report available in the archive.
  - A repeated execution produces no duplicate report or notification.
- **Decisions:**
  - The existing renderer is assumed to support every accepted output format.
  - Recipient authorization and contact validation remain governed by existing
    account policy.
- **Evidence:**
  - This is a fictional example with no project authority; a real specification
    cites its requirement and baseline sources and refers to its `audits.md`.
- **Next step:**
  - Operator sign-off on this example specification would permit planning, not
    implementation.

Feature branch: `001-scheduled-report-delivery`

Created: 2030-01-01

Status: Draft example

Input: Fictional presentation example only

> This file demonstrates specification structure and presentation. Its
> requirements, terminology, and behaviour do not apply to any project.

## Scope

- In scope: **Scheduled reports**, their **recipients**, **generated output**,
  and **delivery outcomes**.
- Out of scope: The existing report **renderer** and manual **report
  generation**.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Receive scheduled reports (Priority: P1)

An account owner **receives** a **scheduled report** without generating it
manually.

Why this priority: Automated **delivery** is the feature's primary user value.

Independent Test: One configured **report** can be **generated**, **archived**,
and **delivered** independently.

#### Acceptance Scenarios

1. GIVEN an **active** report **schedule** with **one recipient**

   WHEN the scheduled **run** occurs

   THEN **one report** is stored in the report **archive**

   AND the recipient **receives** one **delivery notification**

2. GIVEN an **active** report **schedule** with an **empty recipient list**

   WHEN the scheduled **run** occurs

   THEN **one report** is stored in the report **archive**

   AND **no delivery notification** is sent

### User Story 2 - Retry report generation safely (Priority: P2)

An operator can **retry** an interrupted scheduled **run** without creating
**duplicate output**.

Why this priority: Safe **retries** prevent **duplicate reports** and
**notifications**.

Independent Test: One interrupted **run** can be **retried** with its original
**execution identifier** and leave **one archived report**.

#### Acceptance Scenarios

1. GIVEN a completed scheduled **run** with an existing **execution identifier**

   WHEN the operator **retries** that execution

   THEN the report **archive** still contains **one report** for the execution

   AND each configured recipient has at most **one delivery notification**

### Edge Cases

- A **delivery failure** leaves the generated report **available** in the report
  **archive**.
- An **invalid output format** is **rejected** before the report schedule is
  saved.
- An **empty recipient list** **disables delivery** without disabling report
  generation.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- FR-001 - **Configure report delivery**: A report **schedule** **declares** an
  **output format** and may declare a **recipient list**.
- FR-002 - **Preserve generated reports**: Every **successful** scheduled
  **run** stores **one report** in the report **archive**, including when
  **delivery fails** or is **disabled**.
- FR-003 - **Deliver recipient notifications**: A **successful** scheduled
  **run** sends **one notification** to each recipient unless the recipient list
  is **empty**.
- FR-004 - **Make retries idempotent**: Repeating a scheduled run with the **same
  execution identifier** creates **no duplicate report** or **notification**.
- FR-005 - **Reject invalid formats**: An **invalid output format** **prevents
  saving** the report schedule and **identifies the invalid value**.

### Key Entities

- **Report schedule**: Timing, output format, and recipients governing automatic
  report generation.
- **Execution identifier**: Stable identity used to recognize a retried
  scheduled run.
- **Archived report**: Generated output retained independently of delivery.

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes

- SC-001 - **Complete scheduled output**: Every **successful** scheduled **run**
  leaves exactly **one report** in the report archive.
- SC-002 - **Prevent retry duplication**: Repeating an execution creates **zero
  duplicate reports** and **zero duplicate notifications**.
- SC-003 - **Preserve output after delivery failure**: Every report remains
  **available** from the report archive when **delivery fails**.

## Assumptions

- The existing report **renderer** supports every accepted **output format**.
- **Recipient authorization** and **contact validation** remain governed by the
  existing account **policy**.

## Existing Baseline

- Sources consulted: Existing report requirements, delivery architecture,
  relevant work records, maintained regression tests, and the affected report
  scheduler.
- Preserves: Manual report generation and the existing report **renderer**.
- Changes: Adds **scheduled generation**, **optional delivery**, and
  **idempotent retries**.
- Supersedes: None.
- Unaffected: Report content, account authorization, and retention policy.
