# SDLC Engineering Standards Preset

This preset composes the public SDLC standards into Spec Kit 1.0 or later. It
does not replace Spec Kit's specification, planning, task, analysis, or
implementation workflow.

Install this repository with `make install`, which deploys the standards and
installs the CLI helpers. Then run the project initializer from the adopting
project:

```bash
sdlc-project-init
```

It installs this preset, records the project as greenfield or brownfield,
discovers applicable technology standards, renders an editable constitution
scaffold with its adopted SDLC revision, and invokes the selected agent harness.
Inspect or render without launching an agent with:

```bash
sdlc-project-init --no-launch
```

The generated scaffold has no authority before ratification. The agent
populates the brownfield authority map when applicable and adds only durable
project-specific principles, ownership boundaries, and explicit deviations.
Ratification makes the constitution authoritative; later amendments use it
directly rather than reapplying the scaffold. The current Sync Impact Report is
one compact HTML-comment line at the top of the constitution and is replaced on
amendment. A current rerun writes nothing, asks nothing, and does not invoke an
agent.

The command fragments reference the canonical installed root
`~/.agents/sdlc`. No command may search for an alternative SDLC root.

The command fragments require independent `audit-spec`, `audit-design`,
`audit-tests`, and `audit-code` PASS verdicts between stages. The main authoring
context remediates current-phase blocking findings and dispatches fresh audits
for at most five attempts before returning for operator sign-off. The shared
contract is `~/.agents/sdlc/AUDITS.md`. Remove the development preset with:

```bash
specify preset remove sdlc-standards
```
