## SDLC standards

If `~/.agents/sdlc/MAIN.md` is absent or unreadable, report that exact path;
never search for another copy.

Read `~/.agents/sdlc/MAIN.md`, `~/.agents/sdlc/AUDITS.md`,
`~/.agents/sdlc/ISSUES.md`, and
`~/.agents/sdlc/TESTING.md` in full. Check that the specification, plan, and
tasks agree; every material decision is defined at the correct layer; compound
requirements have complete evidence; and no test can pass by inspecting only
source or prose. Give every cited identifier an adjacent descriptor.

For a brownfield feature, also verify that the specification and plan record a
credible context pass across relevant requirement and design authorities,
historical work records, maintained regression tests and traceability, and
affected implementation. Check that the artefacts agree on what is preserved,
changed, superseded, and unaffected without duplicating the baseline.

This consistency analysis does not replace `audit-spec`, `audit-design`,
`audit-tests`, or `audit-code`. A later relevant change preserves the earlier
PASS as revision-specific history but makes it non-current for phase completion
and requires a fresh independent audit of the delta and necessary context.
Follow `AUDITS.md` when resolving analysis findings within the current phase;
do not hand back between remediable revisions and their required fresh audits.
