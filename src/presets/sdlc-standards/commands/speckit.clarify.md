## SDLC standards

The canonical SDLC root is exactly `~/.agents/sdlc`. Never search the
filesystem to locate it. If `~/.agents/sdlc/MAIN.md` is absent or unreadable,
report that exact path.

Read `~/.agents/sdlc/MAIN.md` and
`~/.agents/sdlc/ISSUES.md` in full. Prioritize ambiguities that can change
observable behaviour, scope, architecture, security, persisted data, access,
compatibility, or irreversible outcomes. Resolve those facts in the
specification rather than leaving them to implementation.
