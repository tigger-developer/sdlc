## SDLC standards

The canonical SDLC root is exactly `~/.agents/sdlc`. Never search the
filesystem to locate it. If `~/.agents/sdlc/MAIN.md` is absent or unreadable,
report that exact path.

Read `~/.agents/sdlc/MAIN.md` and
`~/.agents/sdlc/ISSUES.md` in full. Prioritize ambiguities that can change
observable behaviour, scope, architecture, security, persisted data, access,
compatibility, or irreversible outcomes. Resolve those facts in the
specification rather than leaving them to implementation.

Clarification changes invalidate an earlier `audit-spec` PASS. After
clarification is complete, run `audit-spec` in a fresh context and record its
current verdict before planning.
