## SDLC standards

The canonical SDLC root is exactly `~/.agents/sdlc`. Never search the
filesystem to locate it. If `~/.agents/sdlc/MAIN.md` is absent or unreadable,
report that exact path.

Read `~/.agents/sdlc/MAIN.md`, `~/.agents/sdlc/AUDITS.md`,
`~/.agents/sdlc/CODING.md`, and `~/.agents/sdlc/TESTING.md` in full, plus the
constitution's selected standards that apply to the assessment. Distinguish
verified implementation evidence from remaining tasks and give every cited
identifier an adjacent descriptor.

Do not declare convergence while the implementation lacks a current
effective `audit-code` PASS in the feature's `audits.md`. Relevant changes made
during convergence preserve that PASS as revision-specific history but make it
non-current and require a fresh independent audit unless they satisfy an exact
PROVISIONAL condition under `AUDITS.md`.
Follow the autonomous convergence and handback rules in `AUDITS.md` for any
resulting implementation and audit-code cycle.

When one-off or user tests were selected, do not declare convergence unless the
active feature's `validation.md` contains a current PASS for every required
test. A missing, `PENDING`, `FAIL`, or materially stale result blocks
convergence. Preserve superseded audit and validation history, rerunning only
the audits and tests materially affected by later changes.
